# LiteLoaderSDK API Reference

This is the API reference of LiteLoaderSDK, containing all available APIs in the SDK.
However, some of the APIs are not yet tested by LiteLDev members, so they may not work properly.

Meanwhile, this documentation contains additional information for LiteLoaderBDS development, which are not required for plugin development.

If you would just like to create your first plugin, please visit [LiteLoaderSDK Plugin Development Documentation](https://cpp.docs.litebds.com/en/) or [LiteLoaderSDK插件开发文档](https://cpp.docs.litebds.com/zh-Hans/).
