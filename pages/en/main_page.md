# Main Page

This documentation is an overview and explains the important features; details are found in [the API reference](https://cpp.docs.litebds.com/api).

For starters and experts new to LiteLoaderBDS, this guide is the first cornerstone on the road to LiteLoaderBDS C++ plugin development.
Before diving into the API reference, you are strongly recommended to read this guide thoroughly in case you are lost in the ocean of the countless APIs offered by Minecraft official.

Though we LiteLDev members are actively maintaining this guide, this guide is still quite far away from perfect.
In a normal documentation writing workflow, we pick out some undocumented APIs, write a plugin involving those APIs and observe their performance, then describing the information and usage of the API and filling the documentation of those APIs.
If you are eager to make any addition, deletion or modification, please help us complete the documentation following our workflow, and then open a pull request in [our documentation repository](https://github.com/LiteLDev/docs-cpp).
If you have noticed any mistake, doubt or ambiguous place but not ready to contribute, please refer to [our documentation repository](https://github.com/LiteLDev/docs-cpp) to open an issue.
