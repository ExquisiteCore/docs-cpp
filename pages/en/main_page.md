# LiteLoaderSDK Plugin Development Documentation

This is the documentation for LL plugin developers, containing the definitions and the usage of various APIs for plugin development.
If you are a beginner to LL plugin development, please start right here.

However, some APIs supported by LiteLoaderBDS are not shown in this documentation, for they have not been tested by LiteLDev members.
If you would like to browse all APIs, please refer to [LiteLoaderSDK API Reference](https://cpp.docs.litebds.com/api/).
