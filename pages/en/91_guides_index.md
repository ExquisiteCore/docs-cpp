# Guides

For intermediate and advanced developers, guides are the right places to learn new features or complex components of LiteLoaderBDS.

In each guide, we will discuss on a specific topic, introducing a new header, a new class or even a new LLAPI.
In contrast to tutorials, we are not analyzing a complete plugin here.
Instead, we will only point out the focus.

If you have already been an active plugin developer, please browse the content here.
We are sure that the guides can assist you in evolving your plugins.
